title: Where did the gamer go?
---

<p>I've always considered myself a gamer. Since my childhood, I've been an aficionados of the gamepad.</p>
<p>Growing up in the countryside, video games became my only escape from a world in which I didn't really fit in.</p>

<h4>the escape</h4>
<p>In a world where we get offered more and more ways to escape reality but in a time when the internet wasn't really an option, my chosen poison was in the shape of 64MB cartridges and CD-ROMs.</p>

<p>Those games swept me away from my bedroom to their fictional worlds, colourful and magical, dark and dangerous or simply bizarre and made me forget about the bully at school, general malaise as well as my homework.</p>

<p>The hours on end spent trying to reach the end credits while pretending to be a plumber, a small crocodile, or a patient in an asylum will probably stay engraved in my memory forever.</p>

<p>The emotional response that a simple push of a button could produce was thrilling and liberating, as if everything was possible.</p>

<p>Playing made me happy and I thought I'd never stop until I was no longer capable of holding a controller anymore.
When I visited my grandmother at the retirement home, I remember telling myself how lucky they were to have all the time in the world to play video games.</p>

<h4>and suddenly</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, and totally unexpectedly, moving to London changed all that.</p>
<p>Studies, work and social outings took over my life drastically and the gamepads, that once were critical element of my lifestyle, started gathering dust in a corner of my bedroom.</p>

<p>Whether it was video games, skateboarding or any other childhood hobbies, they seem to be doomed to the occasional rainy weekend as we grow older.</p>

<h4>am i still a gamer?</h4>

<p>The recent death of Satoru Iwata, the genius developer turned CEO, a man respected for his amazing work at Nintendo, brought one of his quote into the spotlight: <i>On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer.</i></p>

<p>Surely if being a gamer is in our heart, I'll always be one... right?</p>
