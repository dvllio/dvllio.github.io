title: Banking 2.0
---

<p>Banking as always been considered an old-fashioned business. In most countries, it's also still quite archaic in the way it works, when contactless got democratised a while back, I was quite excited about a new and easiest way of buying my lunch. However, contactless (including Apple Pay and the very recently launched Android Pay), is just a new way of <i>spending</i> but not a new way of <i>banking</i>.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://getmondo.co.uk/">Mondo</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/">Revolut</a> were announced a while back, I discovered something that I didn't think was possible: a bank card configured by a smartphone that reports purchases instantaneously and an amazing way to track your daily spending directly in your pocket computer.</p>

<p>Mondo even offers a public API for its customers, paving the way to a whole new set of ideas.</p>

<p>Extremely excited about the concept, I started following them and even invested in their amazingly short  <a href="https://getmondo.co.uk/blog/2016/03/03/crowdfunded/">Crowdcube campaign</a>, I'm now waiting for my card to arrive with as much excitement as when I was an 8-year-old boy waiting for his Nintendo64.</p>

<p>Even though <a href="https://getmondo.co.uk/">Mondo</a> is a pioneer in <i>Banking 2.0</i>, last week I discovered a German startup that's a few steps further on a few (but not all) levels.</p>

<p>That startup is called <a href="https://number26.eu/">Number26</a> and provides "Europe's most modern bank account" as they coined it. Number26 provides a bank card which seems to be as flexible as Mondo's and Revolut's except that Number26 has a banking licence (in Germany, through a partner bank).</p>

<p>While Mondo and Revolut are (for now) prepaid cards only, Number26 offers a real bank account and even overdrafts in some countries!</p>

<p>Number26 accounts are free of charge (at least for now) and offers quite a few benefits (but no open API yet):</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your bank account via video identification in just 8 minutes
<li>Easily send money to your contacts via text message or email
<li>A free MasterCard allowing free cash withdrawal and fee-free foreign currency transactions
</ul>

<p>The associated mobile app allows you to manage your card and track your spending instantly. Blocking your card from being used at a cash machine or on the web (or both) is now at your fingertips.</p>

<p>The service is, for now, only available in some selected Eurozone countries but should be <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/02/number26-launches-its-bank-of-the-future-in-6-new-countries/">coming to the UK</a> sometime soon, hopefully driving innovation a few steps further.</p>

<p>Banking has been stuck in the past for quite some time. Is 2016 the year when everything changes for us Europeans*? Wait and see!</p>

<small>* yes, even the Brits ;)</small>
